Steps to fetch and import the data:

1. scraper.py - grabs the data from the PDS website and also inserts Image metadata into db (see daily_image/models.py) but the majority of this script is the scraping code

2. get_media.py - fetches the jpg images from the PDS server

3. shuffle.py - shuffles new records into db by giving each unpublished image a new random pub_order

4. tweets.py - writes tweets for each Image and updates the db
